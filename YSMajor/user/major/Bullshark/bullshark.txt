The F-32 Bullshark is a fictional plane I have remodelled from the GAC F-35.
I was inspired by the Boeing X-32 as a competitor to the F-35.

I wanted to make the most detailed aircraft I could possibly make at this time, and so I have used the most detailed items I could find in other airplanes.
I have used: 
- The revolving smoke on 49th pack's F-35B by Makoto.
- The thrust vectoring nozzle and afterburner from the Raven-B of 49th pack.
- The pilot and cockpit of the Leliel of 49th pack.

Thanks and credits to all modders that have helped create those models. I'm not sure who exactly you are but some names I have to mention are:
CEP, Oranleed, WFTC, Bucknasty, Squadron Leader Chunder, and Littlepetslinki. (info from release txt in 49th pack, if your name should be on here too, please contact me)
I hope my F-32 Bullshark will be worthy of a YS squadron repaint as well.

I have intentionally made a plane capable of carrier operations for this reason, since I know many squadrons like to be a VFA.
The F-32's DAT is modified from the Leliel's DAT of the 49th. I have adjusted some values, but the F-32 is still extremely maneuverable and fast.
The shortcomings of the F-32 would be its light weapon load and limited range. 
The external fueltanks on the Air Force version extend its range a bit, but make it lose its stealthy characteristics.

Thank you for your download and best wishes for 2009!

*** AIRCRAFT INFORMATION ***
****************************


The F-32 Bullshark was developed as a competitor to the F-35 Lightning II.
It's slightly smaller than the F-35, and carries a light load in internal weapon bays.
It is very stealthy, and highly maneuverable. 
The HDU (Helmet Display Unit) makes the cockpit very 'clean' lacking a HUD, giving the pilot night vision, and 360 degrees information.

It has vectoring thrust, and strenghtened landing gear for carrier operations.
Both the Navy as well as the Air Force operate F-32's. 
It is the principal fighter/attacker operating from the new super-carrier USS Obama, where strike fighter squadron VFA 28 'The Bullsharks' is based. 

The F-32 can be armed with Aim-9, Aim-120, 250 Lbs bombs, 500 Lbs bombs, and AGM-65's.
It is equiped with a 25mm gatling gun in the left leading edge extension, but has limited ammunitions of only 250 rounds.

For air-superiority missions there are also 2 versions with hardpoints attached to the wings.
This makes the planes less stealthy, but its superior maneuverability always gives the Bullshark the edge.

Operation manual:

Bomb bay 	- opens weapon bays
Flap		- toggles flap and slats
Spoiler		- extends brakes and tailhook
Thrust Reverser - extends refueling probe (only on Navy versions)
Thrust vector 	- folds wings, opens canopy
Elevator down	- when thrust vector is on will move right arm and thumbs up
Gear		- extends landing gear and moves gear doors
Elevator	- moves pilot head up and down, controls elevators and nozzle
Ailerons	- moves pilot head left and right, controls ailerons
Rudder		- controls front gear and nozzle
Afterburner	- ignites afterburner
Thrust		- at 1/3rds of throttle power smoke will appear behind the nozzle
Elevator up	- at speeds higher than 200 kts a vapor cloud will appear on wing surface when turning


Have a safe flight and happy hunting!
