In order for the missions to work you must have the following airplane names in your aircraft list:
('IDENTIFY' name in .dat file)

You see I have listed the AH-6, Mig-27, and Su-33 twice.
That's because CEP refers to Realism pack planes so you will need to install both versions.

If the names are not identical as the name of the corresponding airplanes specified in the .YSF file the missions won't load and the program will shut down.
If this happens either change the names in the .DAT file to correspond, or change the names in the .YSF mission file to correspond.

It's not too difficult really, I figured it out after all. :)
I meant for the missions to be played with above models, but you can change this to your own preferences of course.

Enjoy Airstrike Challenge II!
