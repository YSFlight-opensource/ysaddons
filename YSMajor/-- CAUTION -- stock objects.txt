When copying the stock ground objects into your ground folder, this will 
overwrite the existing stock objects and you will LOSE those!

Please make sure you make a back-up folder with the original files in case
you do not want the change to be permanent.

The stock objects have been repainted into more subdued colours and in some 
cases the file size has decreased.
