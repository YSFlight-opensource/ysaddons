This is the A-10 Warthog, SU-27 and SU-33 SD (Super Deformed - a style of caricature popular with Japanese Anime artists). 

The original design and 3D mesh of this aircraft belongs to Skyline on yspilots.com, I just cleaned up the mesh and convert it into something that YSFlight can use. This is as much his work as it is mine.

Since this aircraft is more of a humorous nature, a large dose of artistic license is called for. So don't complain if you think the performance / weapons load out is not "realistic". :)
