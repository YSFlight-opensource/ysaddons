Features of the detailed version:
- Arrester hook has been fixed in the up position, as Canadian Hornets are land based.
- Use the bombbay door open/close key to turn the navigation lights on/off.
- The original OCP F-18C model has the canopy open when the aircraft is sitting still. The CF-18 version has the canopy closed all the time, but you can still use the variable-geometry wing controls to open/close the canopy.
- The vectored thrust nozzle controls will fold/extend the wings, same as the original OCP version.

Also thanks to fellow ysflight.tk member HotelFox, the nosegear is now stearable - 
something I thought about doing but somehow didn't get around to do it. HF is the author
of the excellent Kapland map, which can be found on his site http://www.cleared4takeoff.de/.
