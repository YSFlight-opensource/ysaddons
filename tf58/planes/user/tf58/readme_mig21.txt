Usage:
1) Use the reverse thrust key to activate the brake chute after you touch down.
2) During approach, try to keep the speed above 140 knots, although 150 knots is preferred. Too slow and your nose will get too high, blocking your view to the runway.
3) Do not exceed a 10 degrees nose up attitude until the wheels left the ground, or you'll risk a tail strike.
4) If you want to fly like a real MiG-21 pilot, observe the following limits:
   - Use 50% flaps for take off.
   - The real MiG-21 is rated at 8.5g, so don't exceed that.
   - Do not exceed 21 degrees angle of attack.
