Special controls for this aircraft:

The flaps are in two stages. The first stage, corresponding to flaps 0 to flaps 10 in real life, where the 3 elements stays together and moves rearwards together, are controlled by YSflight's variable geometry wings control and are automatic. The flaps will automatically extend/retract at 240 knots. You can, of course, use the VGW controls (default are "W" and "S" keys) to override it.

The second stage of flaps, corresponding to flaps 10 to flaps 30 in real life, where the 3 elements starts to split up and drops down, are controlled by the regular flaps control in YSflight.

The F1 cockpit view key will shift between the following views:
- Captain's (normal) view
- First Officer's view
- Jump seat view just behind the center pedestal
- Captain's CDU showing the departure checklist
- F/O's CDU showing the arrival checklist
- Center/common CDU
- cabin view lookout out towards the right wing

If you fly the versions marked "(no_cdu)" then you won't get the CDU views listed above.

The bomb-bay door controls (default is "1" key in YSflight) will toggle the landing lights on/off.

The regular spoiler/airbrake controls will only move the outboard set of spoilers. On a real 747, the inboard set of spoilers are only active when there is weight on the wheels. In the game the inboard spoilers are activated by the reverse thrust control.

DEPARTURE PROCEDURES:

- On departure, rotate at 175 knots.
- You may use 0 or 25 % flaps for departure. If you do use 25% flap, raise them at 200 knots.
- Reduce throttle to climb setting of about 90%.

ARRIVAL / LANDING PROCEDURES:

- Reduce to 220 Knots, flaps 25%.
- Intercept the ILS localizer at about 190 knots.
- Once established on the localizer, reduce speed to 170 knots, flaps 50%, and lower the landing gears. These steps should be completed before intercepting the glideslope.
- Once intercepted the glideslope, reduce speed to Vref of 155 - 165 knots, depends on how much fuel you have.
- Flaps 100%.
- Immediately lower the nose on touchdonw, and engage reverse thrust and spoilers. Do NOT use the brakes above 80 knots.
- Apply brakes at 80 knots.
- Retract the spoilers and disengage reverse thrust at 60 knots.
- Taxi speed is 15 knots. However if a high-speed exit is available you can use that to exit the runway at 30 knots or below.
