Howdy folks!

After using my Decepticon F-15 release to get to know the painting tools
available to me, I decided that my next YSFlight release would be a repaint of
the GAC Extra 300S for the upcoming YSPilots.com LIL' CRaMP 2008 release.

The pattern on the lifting surfaces was inspired by the similar striped pattern
that can be seen on many Pitts biplanes.  I'm a University of Texas alum, so
burnt orange and white were natural color choices for the aircraft, with black
thrown in to make the plane look just that little bit sharper!  Since the colors
were inspired by UT, I've named the plane "Tejas Tornado".

Installation:
1) Exit YSFlight if it's currently running
2) Copy the "ASFalcon13" folder to your YSFlight "user" directory
3) Copy the aircraft-tejastornado.lst file in the "aircraft" directory into your
   YSFlight "aircraft" directory

Special thanks to 2ch for the simple but excellent GAC aircraft models, and to
Taskforce 58 for providing help for srftex.pl.  Also, a big shoutout to all the
painters participating in LIL' CRaMP 2008!

Since I didn't design the aircraft, there's no need to e-mail me for permission if
you wish to use this aircraft for your own painting projects.  All I ask is that
you credit 2ch and myself.

If you have questions, comments, or general maniacal ramblings, drop me a PM at
yspilots.com.

See you in the skies!
ASFalcon13
