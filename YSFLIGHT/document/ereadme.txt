Required Environment
  Windows 98/NT4.0/2000/XP/Vista/7


How to install
  I think you successfully downloaded and extracted the
  files. Please double click SETUP.EXE in the same
  directory as this file, and follow the instruction to
  install.

  You need to have an administrator priviledge to install 
  the program.

  If you don't have an administrator priviledge, change
  the filename of SETUP.EXE to SETUP.ZIP.  Then you can
  manually extract files with an conventional extractor 
  (such as WinZip).  And then double-click on fsmaino.exe or
  fsmaindx.exe to run YSFLIGHT.
  
  When you manually extract files, please make sure you 
  re-construct the directory structure.  If you see all 
  the files in one directory and no sub-directories, you 
  did not extract the files right.  In that case, please
  re-do extraction.



How to use
  Please refer to the manual. You can open the manual by
  choosing

    Start menu
     -> Program
      -> YS FLIGHT SIMULATION SYSTEM 2000
       -> HELP(English)



THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING MY SOFTWARE.
