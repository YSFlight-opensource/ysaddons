        <h2 align="left"><u><a name="IFSLOW"></a>If the program does not run fast...</u></h2>
        <p align="left">
        <img border="0" src="opengl_f18e.png" align="right" width="426" height="279">I designed this program so that you can enjoy if you have a PC
        that are faster than Pentium 500MHz. But, you'll have to turn off some features or lower the resolution to run this program
        on relatively slower PCs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">If you are using YSFLIGHT on Windows, there are three 
        different executables included in the installation package, &quot;CPU 
        Rendered&quot;, &quot;OpenGL&quot;, and &quot;Direct 3D&quot;, which you can choose from Start 
        Menu.</p>
        <p align="left">Most of the recent PCs are equipped with a 
        3D-acceleration capable display adapter (or video card, or graphics 
        chip, or whatever hardware that takes care of what's shown on the 
        monitor.)&nbsp; If your PC is equipped with such a display adapter, you 
        can try &quot;OpenGL&quot; or &quot;Direct 3D&quot;.&nbsp; Some  irresponsible 
        hardware vendors provide an incomplete or defective OpenGL driver.&nbsp; 
        If so, OpenGL version will not perform well, or you may see corrupted 
        images.&nbsp; If you have a problem with OpenGL version, try Direct 3D 
        version.&nbsp; If you are comfortable with OpenGL or Direct 3D versions, 
        you can go with whichever performs better.</p>
        <p align="left">Now, if both OpenGL and Direct 3D versions do not 
        perform ok, most likely your display adapter is not capable of 3D 
        acceleration.&nbsp; Or, your hardware vendor was so irresponsible that 
        they don't provide neither OpenGL nor Direct 3D drivers.&nbsp; Tough 
        luck!&nbsp; But, you still have an option to use &quot;CPU Rendered&quot; version.&nbsp; 
        The graphics quality will be so poor, and the CPU usage easily go up to 
        100%.&nbsp; But, it doesn't require 3D acceleration of your display 
        adapter.</p>
        <p align="left">If you are using Linux, there's no &quot;CPU Rendered&quot; or 
        &quot;Direct 3D&quot; version.&nbsp; Please make sure your X-Window system 
        supports OpenGL.&nbsp; If you installed Linux from scratch, most likely 
        the OpenGL driver was not installed with the basic package.&nbsp; You 
        may need to go through a painful process to install the OpenGL driver.&nbsp; 
        (Painful unless you are an Linux system expert.&nbsp; At least that was 
        painful to me.)&nbsp; But, if you are successful, and if your display 
        adapter supports 3D acceleration, you will be able to enjoy YSFLIGHT in 
        Linux.</p>
        <p align="left">Your choice of the field will affect the speed. Most air fields
        have many facilities, hangars and other ground objects. If your PC is not very fast, the program cannot take care of those ground
        objects quickly. However, the field &quot;SMALL_MAP&quot; does not have many ground objects. If you want to fly a dogfight or an endurance mode,
        you may not care much about the ground. In such cases, choosing &quot;SMALL_MAP&quot; will be better in terms of the program speed.&nbsp;
        In contrast, a map &quot;TOHOKU&quot;, which is available after 20010718
        version, is heavy.&nbsp; You need at least a PenIII450MHz and a fast
        graphics card to play TOHOKU map without stress.&nbsp; &quot;NORTH_KYUSYU&quot; 
        would be the most complex scenery that comes with the standard package, 
        and you may require a decent display adapter to fly comfortably in that 
        scenery.</p>
        <p align="left">If you still feel slow, you can go to <a href="#CONFIGDLG">Configuration Dialog</a>
        and turn off some features. Choose <b> Option-&gt;Config</b> and press "Draw Fast" button.
        Settings will automatically be customized for relatively slower PCs. You can turn off some more features to speed up, but I do not
        recommend. (For the detail, see <a href="#CONFIGDLG">Configuration Dialog</a>)&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">If still you feel slow after turning off features, you can lower

        <p align="left">If you are running this program under Windows NT, you'll feel
        some short stopping while flying. Typically, when you change throttle setting, fire a gun, stop firing a gun etc...
        In such case, go to <a href="#OPTIONDLG">Option Dialog</a> and turn off sound. This Windows NT's stopping is caused by WAV

        <p align="left">
        <img border="0" src="configdlg2.png" width="504" height="440"></p>
        <p align="left"><b>Black Out<br>
        </b>  If this box is on, when you apply a high G force, you will lose visibility  gradually, and finally will be blacked out. (If high negative G force, will  red out).&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Mid Air Collision<br>
        </b>  If this box is on, when you collided with another airplane, your airplane  will get damage, and typically, will crash. If this box is off, your airplane  will never collide with another airplane.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>No Tail Strike Accident</b><br>
        If this box is on, the airplane will not explode when you strike tail on 
        take off or landing.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Can Land Anywhere</b><br>
        If this box is checked, you can land anywhere.&nbsp; However, if the
        speed is too fast (like more than 20kt) the airplane will vibrate
        violently, and ends up crashing or tail-striking.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Rudder Auto Coordination<br>
        </b>  If this box is on, computer automatically control the rudder to eliminate  sideslip of the airplane. To be fair, it is applied to all airplanes flying  (except recorded airplanes). In actual flight, a pilot has to use rudder  pedal while turning so that the airplane will not have side slip. It is called  "turn coordination". But, I guess many users do not have a rudder pedal, and  it is a pain to coordinate a turn by keyboard. So you can turn on this box.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Precise Simulation<br>
        </b>  If this box is on, the program computes dynamics at least every 50ms. If this  box is off, the program computes dynamics once when a screen is refreshed once.  Usually, refreshing a screen takes more time than 50ms. So, if this box is off,  the simulation is less precise. (I don't recommend you to turn off this box.  You may try if this program runs really slow on your PC).&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Always show HUD<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, HUD is shown even when you are
        looking at your airplane from the outside.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Do not Use Instrument Panel<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program draws Head Up Display no matter 
        if the airplane has an instrument panel or not.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Always Draw Player Name<br>
        </b>If<b> </b>this box is checked, player name is always visible.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Virtual Joystick<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, small virtual joystick will be drawn on the 
        screen while flying.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>F8 Camera Delay</b><br>
        If this box is on, external airplane camera (assigned to F8 key by 
        default) follows the airplane with some time delay.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Do not show an airplane on radar if it is below XXXX 
        ft.<br>
        </b>The airplane flying below XXXX ft and far from the player airplane 
        will not be shown on the radar.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Draw Shadow<br>
        </b>  If this check box is on, the shadow of the airplane is drawn precisely  when the airplane is flying low. If this box is off, still the shadow  is drawn, but the shadow is roughly drawn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Shadow of Dead Airplane<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program draws shadow of crashed
        airplanes.&nbsp;</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Ordinance<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program draws ordinances loaded on the
        airplanes.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Coarse Weapon<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program draws weapons with less polygons 
        so that it can draw scenes faster.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Horizon Gradation<br>
        </b>  If this check box is on, you'll see a gradation on the horizon. If  this box is off, no gradation on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Cloud<br>
        </b>  As it is.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Solid Cloud / Flat Cloud<br>
        </b>If Solid Cloud is chosen (default) the cloud will have some volume, 
        otherwise (if Flat Cloud is chosen) the cloud will not have volume (just 
        flat).</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Airplane Graphics</b><br>
        Automatic : Draws high quality model when an airplane is close to the
        viewpoint, and low quality model when far away.<br>
        Always High Quality : Draw high quality model regardless of the distance
        from the viewpoint.<br>
        Always Coarse : Draw low quality model regardless of the distance from
        the viewpoint.&nbsp;</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Draw Light in Daylight<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, runway lights and city lights are visible in
        DAY mode.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Smoke<br>
        </b>Configure type of smoke, how long the smoke remains and the resolution of  the smoke.</p>
        <p align="left">  You can choose a type of smoke from: towel, solid, circle and noodle.  Towel smoke looks like a
        lo---ng towel.  Solid smoke is most similar to actual smoke. But solid smoke takes more  time to draw than other types.  Noodle smoke looks like a
        lo---ng noodle. It can be drawn quickly, but  does not look nice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">  If you choose circle smoke, the smoke is drawn as a sequence of circles.  it cannot be drawn very fast, also does not look good. So I don't  recommend it. I just experimentally implemented this feature.</p>
        <p align="left">  Remain ?? seconds, means as it is.</p>
        <p align="left">Draw every ?? steps specifies the resolution of the smoke. If you specify  smaller number, the resolution becomes better, but the drawing will be  slower. By default, smoke is drawn every 4 steps.&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Fog<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program draws fog, which increases
        reality a little bit.&nbsp; Only available on OpenGL version.&nbsp; This
        option, however, requires a card that can draw OpenGL graphics fast.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b> Z-Buffer Quality<br>
        </b>It specifies quality of Z-Buffering in OpenGL version.&nbsp; You can
        choose one of &quot;LOW(FAST)&quot;, &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;VERY
        HIGH&quot;, and &quot;SUPER HIGH.&quot;&nbsp; Lower Z-Buffer quality
        gives higher frame ratio, but you'll see some objects that are not
        supposed to be visible.&nbsp; Higher Z-Buffer quality gives better
        graphics and you'll less likely see objects that are not supposed to be
        visible, but by sacrificing frame ratio.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Transparent Object (OpenGL only)<br>
        </b>Some objects (typically afterburner) become semi-transparent if it
        is checked.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Transparent Smoke (OpenGL only)<br>
        </b>Smokes become semi-transparent if it is checked.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Transparent Vapor (OpenGL only)<br>
        </b>Vapor become semi-transparent if it is checked.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Reduce Peep Hole Made by Transparent Polygons (OpenGL 
        only)</b><br>
        Transparent polygons sometimes makes <i>peep holes</i> in which you'll 
        see something that is supposed to be hidden by another object.&nbsp; 
        Perfectly eliminating such peep holes is computationally intensive, and 
        will make the program very slow.&nbsp; However, I can reduce such peep 
        holes by slight increase of computation.&nbsp; If you turn this check 
        box on, the program will try to reduce such peep holes.&nbsp; An example 
        of the effect of this check box is shown below.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p align="left"><b>Use Display List for Drawing Cloud<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program uses what is called &quot;display 
        lists&quot; for drawing clouds.&nbsp; If the graphics card has sufficient 
        memory buffer for storing display lists, the drawing performance should 
        increase.</p>          
        <p align="left">Without display lists, the program transfers all 
        polygons every time a scene is drawn.&nbsp; If the object is static and 
        does not move, the program ends up with sending exactly the same 
        information each time, and it creates considerable transaction of data 
        between CPU and the graphics card.&nbsp; Instead of sending the same 
        data many times, the program can transfer a chunk of data to the 
        graphics card only once and later tell the graphics card to draw the 
        chunk of data already stored in the graphics card's memory.&nbsp; By 
        doing this, the program only needs to tell the graphics card the 
        identification number of the chunk of data to draw the same thing.&nbsp; 
        For example, if a missile model consists of 1000 polygons, the program 
        needs to send 1000 polygons to the graphics card for each frame if it 
        does not use display lists.&nbsp; If that many polygons are stored in 
        the graphics card's memory, the program only needs to send one integer 
        number to the graphics card to draw the object.&nbsp; It'll save time 
        for drawing graphics significantly.</p>          
        <p align="left"><b>Use Display List for Drawing Weapons<br>
        </b>If this box is checked, the program uses display lists

        <h2 align="left"><u><b><a name="RADARNAVAID"></a></b>Navigation Aid (VOR 
        and ADF), Instrument Landing System (ILS), and RADAR</u></h2>
        <p align="left"> In YSFLIGHT, you can use two types of navigation 
        equipments, VOR and ADF.</p>
        <p align="left"> A VOR indicates a deviation of a certain course passing 
        through a selected VOR station from your airplane.&nbsp; It also tells 
        if the VOR station is in front of or behind your airplane.&nbsp; Many of 
        the airplanes in YSFLIGHT has two VOR receivers.&nbsp; To distinguish 
        them, one is called NAV1, and the other NAV2.</p>
        <p align="left"> To use VOR, first you select a station, and then 
        specify the course by selecting a course heading called OBS.&nbsp; Press 
        L-key to select a VOR receiver.&nbsp; You will see a menu for selecting 
        a VOR station.&nbsp; Pressing L-key one more time will switch to NAV2, 
        and another stroke will switch to a NDB-selection menu.&nbsp; (NDB is a 
        station for ADF.)&nbsp; After selecting a station, press 7-key or 8-key 
        to change OBS.</p>
        <p align="left"> Meaning of VOR indication is as follows.&nbsp; Assume 
        that you turned your airplane to the OBS heading.&nbsp; The needle of 
        the VOR tells lateral deviation of the course from your airplane.&nbsp; 
        For example, the needle of NAV1 shown below is right of the center.&nbsp; 
        So, if your airplane heading is 360, the VOR station is on your right.&nbsp; 
        Also, beside the OBS is TO/FROM indication.&nbsp; If it says &quot;TO&quot;, the 
        station is ahead of you, or &quot;FR&quot; behind you.</p>
        <table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="432" id="AutoNumber1">
          <tr>
            <td><img border="0" src="nav1.png" width="143" height="144"></td>
            <td><img border="0" src="nav2.png" width="143" height="144"></td>
            <td><img border="0" src="adf.png" width="143" height="144"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NAV1</td>
            <td>NAV2</td>
            <td>ADF</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p align="left"> When I learned it for the first time, my first 
        impression was why is this thing so complicated?&nbsp; But, if you just 
        want to fly to the station, there is an easy way of using it.&nbsp; 
        First select a station, then turn OBS (by 7- or 8-key) until the needle 
        is centered and TO/FROM indication becomes TO.&nbsp; Then, the OBS tells 
        you the heading you must fly to reach the station.</p>
        <p align="left"> You can also tune NAV1 to an ILS, or Instrument Landing 
        System.&nbsp; If you tune NAV1 to an ILS, it will tell you lateral and 
        vertical deviation of the ideal approach path from your airplane.&nbsp; 
        The vertical deviation is shown by the horizontal needle called glide 
        slope.&nbsp; The vertical needle will show you the lateral deviation of 
        the ideal approach course from your airplane.&nbsp; So, once you are on 
        the approach course, you will be able to fly an ideal approach path by 
        chasing the needle.&nbsp; You can also tune NAV2 to an ILS, but it does 
        not have glide slope indication.&nbsp; When you tune NAV1 or NAV2 to an 
        ILS, OBS does not have an effect on the indication.</p>
        <p align="left"> If an airplane is equipped with HUD, ILS needle will 
        also be shown on the HUD as shown below.</p>
        <p align="left"><img border="0" src="ils.png" width="234" height="182"><br>
        　</p>
        <p align="left">ADF is a lot more simple.&nbsp; ADF needle will tell a 
        relative direction to the selected NDB station from your airplane.&nbsp; 
        If you keep the needle centered, you will eventually come to above the 
        NDB station.</p>
        <p align="left"></p>
        <p align="left">Also RADAR equipment is available for air combat and anti-ground attack. You can
        turn on the RADAR or change the RADAR range by 3 key or trigger 3 of the joystick.
        The RADAR range cycles through OFF -> 5 miles -> 10 miles -> 50 miles -> (repeat).&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The RADAR has three modes as Anti-Air, Anti-Ground and Bombing. The mode changes
        automatically when you change the wapon of choice.</p>

        objects and Green marks are hostile objects. A small tip of line attached to the
        square show the flying directions of the airplane.</p>
        <p align="left">Anti-Ground mode is almost same as the Anti-Air mode, but it shows more
        objects in front of the airplane than ones behind the airplane.</p>
        <p align="left">In Bombing mode, the circle on the radar shows the estimated impact point of
        the bomb. If you are flying B-2 or Tu-144, you can carpet bomb referring to

        using Windows XP Service Pack 2, you need to unblock YSFLIGHT from 
        Windows Firewall.&nbsp; Please follow <a href="xpsp2e.html">this link</a> 
        for more information.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">Since 20001125 release version, YSFLIGHT2000 features network play.
        More than one player can fly a same airspace and fight against each other.  Or you can cooperatively attack heavily defended ground
        target.  If your PCs are connected to a high speed (10Mbps or faster) connection, you may be able to fly a formation of 6 airplanes and
        perform an aerobatic flight.  I haven't tested how many players are practically possible, but theoretically, the program must accept 17
        players at maximum.</p>
        <p align="left">Since 20021205 release version, you can play <a href="#INSTANTDOGFIGHT">Endurance
        Mode</a> and <a href="#INTERCEPTMISSION">Intercept Mission</a> over the
        network.&nbsp; You can cooperatively attack against computer airplanes
        or defend your base with your friend.&nbsp; To start the endurance mode,
        press E key in the server menu.&nbsp; To start the Intercept mission,
        press B key in the server menu.&nbsp; If you want to terminate the
        Endurande mode or the Intercept mission, press T key.&nbsp; (Pressing T
        key does not delete already flying computer airplanes.&nbsp; You have to
        take care of them anyway.)</p>
        <p align="left">In the network play, you may get damage even when you don't see any
        bullets or missiles striking your airplane.  In such a case, your opponent's airplane is seeing his bullet or missile striking your
        airplane.  It is because there is always some delay in transmitting position information.  This problem can be moderated if I write a
        smart code that expect future path of the airplane, however, instead of making my code smart, I made a rule of the network play as follows.&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><b>Say user A is flying an airplane P in computer X, and user B is flying
          an airplane Q in computer Y.  If user A fired a weapon and the weapon strikes airplane Q in either one of (or both) computer X or computer Y, airplane
          Q gets damage.&nbsp;</b></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In summary, if you really see your airplane being hit, or your opponent
        sees his weapon striking your airplane, you get damage.</p>
        <p>Consequently, even you think that your opponent's bullets are strayed
        from your airplane, say 20m behind you, you shouldn't stop your maneuver to avoid opponent's attack.  If you are flying at 200m/s,
        and if the network delay is 0.1 second, you'll see your opponent's bullets strayed 20m behind you when your opponent is seeing his
        bullets striking directly your airplane.  And, this is a game to play happily.  Don't begin fist fight screaming "Hey, your bullet
        didn't hit me!  You did something unfair!".  Your opponent is not unfair.  It is a nature of
        network play.</p>
        <p>If you want to fly with a friend who is apart from you, you may want
        to chat with your friend while flying, though, YSFLIGHT2000 itself does
        not transmit texts for chatting.&nbsp; In such a case, you can open an
        external chatting program beside YSFLIGHT2000's window.&nbsp; However,
        while you are chatting with your friend, you cannot control your
        airplane.&nbsp; In order not to crash your airplane while chatting, you
        can use auto-pilot.&nbsp; If you press BS (backspace) key, your airplane
        will fly a holding pattern until you press BS key once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>But, I don't recommend to use voice chat and YSFLIGHT2000 at the
        same time.&nbsp; Experiments showed that Windows may freeze if you try
        to use voice chatting program and YSFLIGHT2000 at the same time.&nbsp;
        You can avoid this problem by turning off YSFLIGHT2000's sound
        effects.&nbsp; However, even if you successfully start YSFLIGHT2000,
        practically you cannot fly with your friend over network because the
        network-load of voice transmission eats bandwidth up and YSFLIGHT2000
        cannot transmit airplane's position, state etc.</b></p>
        <p><img border="0" src="serverclient.png" align="right" width="227" height="189">To play over the network, one player needs one computer.  And, one
        computer must work as a server.  The other computers must connect to the server as clients.  The figure on the right shows an
        schematic image of the network connection.  A player in front of the computer can join the flight either when a computer is working
        as a server or when a computer is connected to the server.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To begin a server, choose Network menu -&gt; Server and type your name.  To access to a server as a client, choose Network menu -&gt;
        Client, and type your name and the network hostname of the server.</p>

      <p align="left">When you fly a very good flight, you may want to show
      your flight record to your friend by sending the flight record by E-Mail
      or by posting it on your Web site.&nbsp; However, a flight record file
      tends to be big, often too big to send by E-Mail or to store in your Web
      space that your internet service provider gave you.&nbsp; In such a case,
      you can 'decimate' your flight record to reduce the size of a flight
      record file.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial">CAUTION: These operations are not
      undoable.&nbsp; I recommend to save your raw flight record before

      <p align="left">There are two ways to decimate a flight record.&nbsp; One
      reduces the time precision, and the other reduces the space
      precision.&nbsp; To reduce the time precision, choose &quot;Flight Record <u>U</u>tility&quot;-&gt;&quot;Set
      Time Precision&quot; and specify the time step.&nbsp; Default time step is
      0.05 second, thus the flight record is taken once every 0.05 second.&nbsp;
      By specifying larger number, you can reduce the size of a flight record.</p>
      <p align="left">To reduce the space precision, choose &quot;Flight Record
      Utility&quot;-&gt;&quot;Set Space Precision&quot; and specify the space
      precision in meters.&nbsp; The default space precision is 0.01, which
      means two digits after decimal point will be stored in the flight record
      file.&nbsp; By specifying larger number, you can reduce the size of a

        <p align="left">Blue Impulse 3D Graphics SDK is designed for interactive
        3D visualization programs. I developed it for my master's thesis research project. It runs in a acceptable speed
        even in a relatively slow platforms. One advantage of the toolkit is cross-platform capability. Actually, if I re-compile
        source code of this flight simulator in SGI or X-Window environment, it runs (Except dialog boxes and joystick
        features. I just used #ifdef WIN32,#endif for those WIN32 depending part). Another advantage is scalability. If
        you build a program in a relatively slower platform, you'll want to use flat-shaded version. But, you can get smooth&nbsp;<br>
        shaded version just by re-compile with the library file of OpenGL implementation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">YS Geometric Calculation Library provides wide variety of
        3D calculation features, including basic vector classes, matrix classes, shell classes, intersection/collision
        detection..... This library also has template classes like array, linked list etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Both toolkits are free and open source. Please visit the
        Web site.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Blue Impulse 3D Graphics SDK is a foundation toolkit of

            Fly a formation leader of world famous "United States Navy Blue Angels",
            "United States Airforce Thunderbirds" or "Japan Air Self Defence Force Blue Impulse".
            At the beginning, you'll be on runway. You'll see another three airplanes behind
            (use M key to look back).&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left">To take off, turn on afterburner and push the throttle to the max power
          (press TAB key once and press Q key until the power becomes max, or just
          push your throttle lever forward if you have an external throttle lever).&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">After air-bourn, keep the nose 10 to 15 degree pitch. Press B key or use POV to
          look back periodically. You'll see the #4 airplane sliding into its position. After #4 took in position, turn off the afterburner and reduce the
          power to the half of military (press TAB once again and press A key until the
          power becomes half, or just pull your throttle lever back to that power).&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">Again, use M key or POV control, wait until other airplanes catch up you.
          You can make smooth turn during this procedure.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">At this point, you can fly what ever you want. But, remember that you are the
          formation leader. You must not perform a rapid maneuver, especially lateral
          maneuvers (rolling). You have to fly really nice and smooth. You also should
          not use max power or minimum power with airbrake. If you fly so, they cannot
          keep up with you because other airplanes have the same flight dynamic characteristic (no more acceleration or
          deceleration). You also have to&nbsp;<br>
          keep between 200kt and 500kt until landing.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">If you pull your trigger 1 or 2, other airplanes will draw a smoke with you.
          You can try, diamond roll, diamond loop, and whatever diamond something
          maneuver with trailing smoke. You should keep plus G (more than 2.0G is
          good) while you are performing a formation aerobatic maneuver.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">Finally, you should land your airplane to the runway. Your wingmen will just
          follow you. So, you have to land exactly on the centerline of the runway.&nbsp;</p>

        Please don't ask me that question(^_^;) But, you can attack them. Some maps
        also has the start position "CLOSE BY THE GROUND TARGETS". If you choose it,
        you'll start flying several miles away from the ground targets. Otherwise,
