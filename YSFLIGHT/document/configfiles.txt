Linux version does not have a nice dialog box for changing configuration.  Please modify configuration files manually.  The configuration files are located under config directory.


[flight.cfg]
SMOKETYPE Type
  Type can be one of NOODLE, TOWEL, CIRCLE, or SOLIDh
SMOKETIME 30.000000
  Time (in seconds) that a smoke trail remains visible.
SMOKESTEP 4
  Resolution of a smoke trail.  A smaller number gives a better
  smoke trail, but takes longer time to draw.
DRWSHADOW TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws shadows.
HRIZNGRAD TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws gradation near horizon.
  This setting is ignored DRAWFOG__ is TRUE.
DRAWCLOUD TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws clouds.
GBLACKOUT TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the prgram darkens when high positive G is applied and
  reddens when high negative G is applied.
ACCURATET TRUE/FALSE
  If it is FALSE, the program does a kind of corner-cutting to
  reduce computational time for calculating airplane dynamics.
AUTORUDDR TRUE/FALSE
  Enables/disasbles automatic-rudder coordinator.
MIDAIRCOL TRUE/FALSE
  Enables/disables mid air collision (actually, not necessarily
  in mid air though.)
SHADWDEAD TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws shadows of dead airplanes.
  This setting is ignored if DRWSHADOW is FALSE.
DRAWORDIN TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws weapons loaded on
  airplanes.
COARSEWPN TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws coarse weapons.
DRAWFOG__ TRUE/FALSE
  Specify if the program draws fog.  If this setting is TRUE,
  HRIZNGRAD is ignored.

  Specify the visibility.  You need to have unit (m) at the
  end without separating by a space or a tab.
ZBUFFQUAL 0,1,2, or 3
  Specify the quality of Z-Buffering.
  0:lowest but fastest
  3:highest but slowest.
DEFAIRPLN "F-16C_FIGHTINGFALCON"
  Specify the default player airplane.
HUDALWAYS FALSE
  Specify if the program draws the head up display.
JSCALIBRA FALSE
  Specify if the program re-calibrates joystick at the startup.
  Apparently, my calibration routine is not very good, and
  shouldn't set this setting TRUE  :-P
AIRLVODTL 0,1,2, or 3
  Specify the quality of airplane graphics.
  0:Default (use a coarse model when an airplane is far from the viewpoint)
  1:Always high quality
  2:Always coarse
  3:Paper airplane
GNDLVODTL 0,1, or 2
  Specify the quality of ground object graphics.
  0:Default (use a coarse model when an airplane is far from the viewpoint)
  1:Always high quality
  2:Always coarse
DRWPLRNAM TRUE/FALSE
  If it is FALSE, player name is visible only when the head up display
  is visible.
DRWLITDAY TRUE/FALSE
  If it is FALSE, runway lights and city lights are invisible when
  the environment is day.
TRANSPARE TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, afterburners and cockpit windows (planned) become
  semi-transparent.
TRSPVAPOR TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, vapor trails are drawn semi-transparent.
TRSPSMOKE TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, smoke trails are drawn semi-transparent.
LANDANWHR TRUE/TRUE
  If it is TRUE, airplanes can land anywhere.  However, if the
  speed exceeds 15kt and lands out of runway, airplane vibrate
  violently and may end up with crashing.
ENVIRONME DAY/NIGHT
  Specify environment.
DEFFIELD_ "ATSUGI_AIRBASE"
  Specify the default field.
DEFSTPOS_ "RW01_01"
  Specify the default start position.
JSWARNING TRUE/FALSE
  If TRUE, the program shows the warning message "Joystick is not
  connected or not configured" when a joystick axis is assigned to a
  control function and joystick is not detected.
TRSPLATER TRUE/FALSE
  If TRUE, transparent polygons are drawn after all non-transparent
  polygons.  It reduces the peep hole effect caused by a transparent
  polygon.
CAMERADLY TRUE/FALSE
  If TRUE, the external airplane camera, initially F8 key is assigned,
  will chase the airplane with some delay.



[network.cfg]
USEMISSILE TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the server allows air to air missiles.
SERVERWAIT TRUE/FALSE
  (Not used now)
DEFAULTHST ""
  Specify the default host name in the client mode.
PORTNUMBER 7915
  Specify the default port number.
DEFAULTUSR "USERNAME"
  Specify the default user name.  If you use "USERNAME", the program
  automatically gives you "Nameless."
RECORDCLNT TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the program takes flight record in the client mode.
RECORDSRVR TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the program takes flight record in the server mode.
DEFLTFIELD "NEWTA_AIRBASE"
  Specify the default field name in the server mode.
DFSTPOSSVR "NORTH10000_01"
  Specify the default start position in the server mode.
DEFIFFSRVR 0,1,2, or 3
  Specify the default IFF (identify friend or foe) code in the server mode.
DEFIFFCLNT 0,1,2, or 3
  Specify the default IFF code in the client mode.
DFSTPOSCLI "SOUTH10000_01"
  Specify the default start position in the client mode.
GROUNDFIRE TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the server allows ground to air fire.
FREECLIENT TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the program frees memory when possible in the client mode.
  Actually, there are many problem reports including the server crash
  problem when this setting is TRUE.  The cause of the server crash
  is still unknown and I could not re-produce the same problem in
  my environment.  I only could make some defensive modifications,
  so, you may want to turn this setting off if you experience problems
  during playing over network.
FREESERVER TRUE/FALSE
  Specify whether the program frees memory when possible in the server mode.

  during playing over network.
SENDBLKOUT TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, the server sends the "GBLACKOUT" setting of flight.cfg to
  clients.  Otherwise, clients uses their own "GBLACKOUT" setting.
SENDLDAWHR TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, the server sends the "LANDANWHR" setting of flight.cfg to
  clients.  Otherwise, clients uses their own "LANDANWHR" setting.
SENDMIDAIR TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, the server sends the "MIDAIRCOL" setting of flight.cfg to
  clients.  Otherwise, clients uses their own "MIDAIRCOL" setting.
NOGUNSIGHT TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, all the clients connected to the server do not show lead
  gun sight regardless the local configuration.
SAMEVERSIN TRUE/FALSE
  If it is TRUE, the server only accepts connection from clients of the
  same YSFLIGHT version.
SVRRESETTM Nmin
  If other than 0min is specified, the server resets itself once every N
  minutes.  Warning messages are sent to the clients 30, 15, 10, 5, and 1
  minutes before resetting.
ENTSVRAFTR M
  If non zero minutes is specified for SVRRESETTM, the server will terminate
  automatically after resetting M times.  By using SVRRESETTM and ENTSVRAFTR
  together, you can set up a server that runs specific duration of time.
  For example, if you set as:

    SVRRESETTM 360min 
    ENTSVRAFTR 9

  The server runs 360 minutes times 9 = 3240 minutes, which corresponds to
  54 hours.  If you set up a task scheduler so that it starts a server at
  6pm every Friday with the following command line:

    ysflight -server AutoServer -autoexit

  The server starts at 6pm on Friday, and terminates 0am on Monday.



[option.cfg]
SCREENMOD 0
  Ignored in Linux version.
SOUND TRUE
  Ignored in Linux version.
OPENDEMO TRUE/FALSE
  If it is true, the program shows opening dogfight demonstration.
